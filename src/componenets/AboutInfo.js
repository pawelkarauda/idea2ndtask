                    We use probably the most agile stack available. Combination
                    of Ruby on Rails or Express in the backend and React in the
                    front-end let us work fast, build scalable applications and
                    deliver enormous amount of business value per hour. Our devs
                    make use of all the power of both technologies. We are
                    open-source enthusiasts therefore we implement opinionated
                    and proven community solutions to the most popular problems.
                    It additionally saves tons of time, especially when the
                    communities for our technologies are strong and active
                    worldwide.
